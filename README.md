## TinyVM

A simple VM to play with LLVM's MCJIT compiler and exercise a new OSR technique.

The TinyVM command line supports the invocation of loaded functions. Functions
can be invoked as in C, except for the final semi-colon that must not be added.
For the time being, only functions with integer arguments and return values are
supported.

Demo OSR points can be inserted with one of the following commands:
INSERT_OSR <PROB> <COND> OPEN UPDATE IN <F1> AT <P1> CLONE
INSERT_OSR <PROB> <COND> OPEN COPY IN <F1> AT <P1> AS <F1'> CLONE
INSERT_OSR <PROB> <COND> OPEN UPDATE IN <F1> AT <P1> DYN_INLINE <V1>
INSERT_OSR <PROB> <COND> OPEN COPY IN <F1> AT <P1> AS <F1'> DYN_INLINE <V1>
INSERT_OSR <PROB> <COND> SLVD UPDATE IN <F1> AT <P1> TO <F2> AT <P2> AS <F2'>
INSERT_OSR <PROB> <COND> SLVD COPY IN <F1> AT <P1> AS <F1'> TO <F2> AT <P2> AS <F2'>

where:
	PROB is either -1 (no branch weight) or an integer in {0, ..., 100}
	COND is ALWAYS, NEVER, or COUNT <THRESHOLD>
	OPEN (open OSR) means the continuation function is generated when
        the OSR is fired
	SLVD (resolved OSR) generates the continuation function right away
	UPDATE instruments the original function
	COPY instruments a copy of the original function
	F1 and F2 are existing functions
	P1 and P2 are locations in F1 and F2 respectively
	V1 is the target of one or more calls in F1

The command can either update F1 or generate a new function F1' cloning F1 such
that when P1 is reached during the execution, an OSR transition is fired.

At the moment, counter-based OSR conditions are supported in UPDATE mode only.

For OPEN transitions, a continuation function C is generated at run-time.
In CLONE mode, C is generated by cloning and manipulating F1 to resume the
execution at P1. In DYN_INLINE mode, C is generated as in clone mode, then a
dynamic inliner attempts to inline calls whose target is contained in V1.

For SLVD transitions, a continuation function F2' is statically generated from
F2 to resume the execution at P2.

Program locations can be expressed using an LLVM '%name' (including numerical
IDs for anonymous values) or a line ID '$i' reported by SHOW_LINE_IDS. For basic
block locations OSR points are inserted before the first non-PHI instruction.
