## TinyVM

A simple VM to play with LLVM's MCJIT compiler and exercise a new OSR technique.

The TinyVM command line supports the invocation of loaded functions. Functions
can be invoked as in C, except for the final semi-colon that must not be added.
For the time being, only functions with integer arguments and return values are
supported.
TinyVM> HELP COMP_CODE
Manipulate compensation code for OSR points:
--> COMP_CODE <OP> FOR <F1> AT <P1> TO <F2> AT <P2>

where:
	OP is one of the following actions: CHECK, CAN_BUILD, BUILD
	F1 and F2 are existing functions
	P1 and P2 are locations in F1 and F2 respectively

COMP_CODE can CHECK whether a compensation code is required to perform an OSR
transition from P1 to P2, verify if OSRKit CAN_BUILD it automatically and
actually BUILD it.

Program locations can be expressed using an LLVM '%name' (including numerical
IDs for anonymous values) or a line ID '$i' reported by SHOW_LINE_IDS. When a
basic block is specified, its first non-PHI instruction is picked as location.
TinyVM> HELP INSERT_OSR
OSR points can be inserted with one of the following commands:
--> INSERT_OSR <PROB> <COND> OPEN UPDATE IN <F1> AT <P1> CLONE
--> INSERT_OSR <PROB> <COND> OPEN COPY IN <F1> AT <P1> AS <F1'> CLONE
--> INSERT_OSR <PROB> <COND> OPEN UPDATE IN <F1> AT <P1> DYN_INLINE <V1>
--> INSERT_OSR <PROB> <COND> OPEN COPY IN <F1> AT <P1> AS <F1'> DYN_INLINE <V1>
--> INSERT_OSR <PROB> <COND> SLVD UPDATE IN <F1> AT <P1> TO <F2> AT <P2> AS <F2'>
--> INSERT_OSR <PROB> <COND> SLVD COPY IN <F1> AT <P1> AS <F1'> TO <F2> AT <P2> AS <F2'>

where:
	PROB is either -1 (no branch weight) or an integer in {0, ..., 100}
	COND is either ALWAYS or NEVER
	F1 and F2 are existing functions
	P1 and P2 are locations in F1 and F2 respectively
	V1 is the target of one or more calls in F1

The command can either update F1 or generate a new function F1' cloning F1 such
that when P1 is reached during the execution, an OSR transition is fired.

For OPEN transitions, a continuation function C is generated at run-time.
In CLONE mode, C is generated by cloning and manipulating F1 to resume the
execution at P1. In DYN_INLINE mode, C is generated as in clone mode, then a
dynamic inliner attempts to inline calls whose target is contained in V1.

For SLVD transitions, a continuation function F2' is statically generated from
F2 to resume the execution at P2.

Program locations can be expressed using an LLVM '%name' (including numerical
IDs for anonymous values) or a line ID '$i' reported by SHOW_LINE_IDS. When a
basic block is specified, its first non-PHI instruction is picked as location.
TinyVM> HELP MAPS
Manipulate StateMap objects:
--> MAPS SHOW
--> MAPS ANALYZE <F1> <F2>
--> MAPS UPDATE <F1> <F2>

MAPS can SHOW all the available StateMap objects, and for a specific StateMap on
functions F1 and F2 it can either ANALYZE it to show which pairs of locations
are feasible for OSR, or UPDATE it to reflect changes made to the functions
using the OPT command.
TinyVM> HELP OPT
Syntax:
    OPT <function_name> { <opt1> <opt2> ... << <optN> }

List of OSR-compatible implemented function passes:
--> ADCE
	Aggressive dead code elimination (assume dead unless proved otherwise).
--> ConstProp

	Remove trivially redundant instructions with a dominator tree walk.
--> LCSSA
	Transform loops into loop-closed SSA form.
--> LICM
	Loop-invariant code motion (hoist & sink).
--> LoopSimplify
	Canonicalize natural loops.
--> SCCP
	Sparse conditional constant propagation.
--> Sink
	Sink instructions into successor blocks.
